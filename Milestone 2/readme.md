## Mocking

  For meeting-bot, we would use google calendar API. For this milestone we have mocked google calendar data using Json objects. We have created Jsons based on users' calendars and we are storing her/his status about availability (busy/available) into it. This Json will consist of users names and meeting rooms. And we have mocked this data and used in our bot.js for read and write purpose. Here we have used array to store slots of user's calendar and availability for each date. We have imported this mocked json into bot.js file and bot can also write to this mocked file.
  Please find mock.json file here

## Bot Implementation

  Azra bot is a meeting bot that schedules a meeting for specified users. It checks calendars of such users through mock.json and returns the free time of users and asks meeting-coordinator to confirm meeying timing and schedules accordingly.
